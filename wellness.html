            <p class="cream">One of my life goals is to be able to touch my fingertips to burning oil without being burned. For many years, I have watched my grandma reach into a frying pan to flip her latkes, and she has never once complained of being burned. What’s a latke, you ask? The word is Yiddish, and it means “small pancake.” Latkes are Jewish potato pancakes.</p>

            <p class="cream">I am a freshman in my second semester of college. While I enjoy classes and clubs and playing lacrosse, I constantly have to battle against my archenemy: busyness. My schedule is constantly filled with to-do lists, and no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to finish everything I have planned for the day. I think that this is true for most people,  whether they are still in college or out in the “real world.” We devote our lives to our jobs and careers, we play sports and take our children to Little League practice, we stay up late and wake up early. What we often miss in the midst of all this busyness is the importance of making room for rest.</p>

            <p class="cream">It’s no secret that women today are under a lot of pressure—pressure to be the perfect mom, to break the glass ceiling, to achieve a certain physique or even to have certain winning personality traits. Even in the rising feminist movement that is supposed to empower women, we fall victim to the same pressures to act a certain way or achieve certain goals. It can be hard to escape from the noise around us, particularly when that noise is generated by people we admire.</p>

            <h5 class="mustard">by Julie Berry</h5>
            <p class="cream">If the healthy lifestyle were a movie, bacteria would be cast as the villains. These tiny parasites—too small to be seen without the aid of a microscope—can wreak havoc on our bodies and our lives. Scientists estimate that millions of bacterial species exist, and many of these have yet to be discovered. Those that have been studied range from annoying (Streptococcus pyogenes, the culprit behind your last nasty case of Strep throat) to life-threatening (Clostridium tetani, the tetanus-causing baddie that lurks around rusty nails).</p>

            <p class="cream">For years, I treated my body as a collection of dissected parts. An oral antibiotic for this infection, an antidepressant for this feeling, a pill for this symptom. Then, in my senior year of high school, I threw all of those treatments away. I remember sitting in the parking lot of a natural health practitioner, considering my options: 1) Continue taking the prescription antidepressants that were giving me a stable mood with a host of side effects. 2) Wean myself off of these pills at the medical doctor’s recommendation. 3) Stop taking prescription pills immediately and begin to follow the alternative plan outlined by the natural health practitioner.</p>
