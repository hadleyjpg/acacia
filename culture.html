                <h2>playing the part: women & ambition</h2>
                <h5>by Aylssa Martin</h5>
                <p class="cream">“When are you getting engaged?” This question permeated so many of my conversations during my college years. Many people found my career goals and post-graduation plans far less interesting than the possibility of a wedding in my future. In a college culture that glorified the concept of marriage, encountering these conversations challenged me to explore the root of the questions being asked.</p>

What could go wrong? When Jessica Walsh and Timothy Goodman, two New York City-based graphic designers, agree to set aside their platonic friendship and date each other for forty days in an effort to resolve their different relationship issues, many of their friends believe they are crazy.</p>

                <p class="cream">I found my unique artistic style through the daily cultivation of creativity. A few years ago, I was snapping photographs of everything in sight with a brand-new Canon Rebel, taking classes on graphic design and using Photoshop to illustrate every picture I could get my hands on. Yet despite this frenzy of creative activity, I found that I had problems with everything I made.</p>

                <h5>by Emily Houp</h5>
                <p class="cream">Paths. They were one of the first attributes of human technology and development. They are fossils of anthropological movement, proof of where patterns and progress in civilizations were made. The ancient Mesopotamian Empire, one of the first recorded societies, was drizzled with beautiful, tiny pathways between stone houses and government meeting halls, water resources and town dwelling places, all throughout the city. These paths reveal secrets of daily life and community within the context of 4000 B.C.</p>

                <h5 class="green">by Sarah Browning</h5>
                <p class="cream">In Deep Play, Diane Ackerman explores how essential the quality of play is to a life well-lived. She uses examples of physical play, animal play and spiritual play to illustrate that approaching life with a sense of deep playfulness helps us grow by creatively putting pressure on and breaking through mental barriers. Deep Play gives words to an innate desire for playfulness that many of us feel without knowing why.
