                <p class="cream">Entrepreneurship. The word itself is not ambiguous, but the way that we understand it varies greatly from person to person. Some people view entrepreneurship as a means to an end, a way to attain wealth and success. Others understand it as a discipline, a display of personal prowess and business savvy that will gain them admiration and influence in their communities. For Susannah Sizemore, a native of Lexington, Kentucky, entrepreneurship means so much more than a path to shallow success. It is a dream that has captivated her since she was a little girl.

                <p class="cream">Paths. They were one of the first attributes of human technology and development. They are fossils of anthropological movement, proof of where patterns and progress in civilizations were made. The ancient Mesopotamian Empire, one of the first recorded societies, was drizzled with beautiful, tiny pathways between stone houses and government meeting halls, water resources and town dwelling places, all throughout the city. These paths reveal secrets of daily life and community within the context of 4000 B.C.</p>

Lydia Underwood, a senior art major from Lexington, Kentucky, plans to teach English as a Second Language in China after graduating from college.  Yet for her, connecting with people on a global scale begins not with English but with watercolors, printmaking and typography.</p>

                <p class="cream">Honestly the past years I cared a lot what people thought. People are so quick to judge what they see. The past year I wrote a little note on my website about working on my self love. Seeing my own beauty. So I decided to tone down my make up or wear none and wear literally whatever even if it didn’t make sense. But it boosted my confidence to an all time high so I just tried to slay without looking my best. So I’ve just been keeping my style to a unique minimum. I would say my style has changed a lot and probably will again.</p>

                <p class="cream">I am a freshman in my second semester of college. While I enjoy classes and clubs and playing lacrosse, I constantly have to battle against my archenemy: busyness. My schedule is constantly filled with to-do lists, and no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to finish everything I have planned for the day. I think that this is true for most people,  whether they are still in college or out in the “real world.” We devote our lives to our jobs and careers, we play sports and take our children to Little League practice, we stay up late and wake up early. What we often miss in the midst of all this busyness is the importance of making room for rest.</p>

A few years ago, I was snapping photographs of everything in sight with a brand-new Canon Rebel, taking classes on graphic design and using Photoshop to illustrate every picture I could get my hands on. Yet despite this frenzy of creative activity, I found that I had problems with everything I made.</p>

                <p class="cream">For years, I treated my body as a collection of dissected parts. An oral antibiotic for this infection, an antidepressant for this feeling, a pill for this symptom. Then, in my senior year of high school, I threw all of those treatments away. I remember sitting in the parking lot of a natural health practitioner, considering my options: 1) Continue taking the prescription antidepressants that were giving me a stable mood with a host of side effects. 2) Wean myself off of these pills at the medical doctor’s recommendation. 3) Stop taking prescription pills immediately and begin to follow the alternative plan outlined by the natural health practitioner.</p>
