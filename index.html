                <p class="cream">Entrepreneurship. The word itself is not ambiguous, but the way that we understand it varies greatly from person to person. Some people view entrepreneurship as a means to an end, a way to attain wealth and success. Others understand it as a discipline, a display of personal prowess and business savvy that will gain them admiration and influence in their communities. For Susannah Sizemore, a native of Lexington, Kentucky, entrepreneurship means so much more than a path to shallow success. It is a dream that has captivated her since she was a little girl.
