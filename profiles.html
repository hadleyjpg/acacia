            <p class="cream">Do you ever wonder what life is like for that one friend of yours from college? You know, the one who had the guts to chase their dreams, who committed to making music or writing novels for a living, who hung their diploma on the wall and never looked back. For me, that friend is Abby Hamilton: a country music singer-songwriter based in Lexington, Kentucky. One year out from her college graduation, she will be the first person to tell you the truth about what it’s like to kick off a career in music as a young, unestablished artist.</p>

            <p class="cream">Nicole Woolls needed a job. She and her husband, Brownrygg, were relocating to Florida so they could live closer to Nicole’s family. She had applied for nearly thirty jobs in the Sunshine State, but none had truly ignited her passion—at least, not until the Department of Defense called.</p>

            <p class="cream">Art has the power to communicate beyond cultural and language barriers. Lydia Underwood, a senior art major from Lexington, Kentucky, plans to teach English as a Second Language in China after graduating from college.  Yet for her, connecting with people on a global scale begins not with English but with watercolors, printmaking and typography.</p>

            <h5 class="green">by Anna Leigh Morrow</h5>
            <p class="cream">When I first heard Amena Brown speak at a university-wide convocation during my senior year of college, I was immediately struck by her gift for storytelling. Her speaking style is engaging, honest, humorous and moving. She has a knack not just for spoken word poetry, which is how she built a name for herself, but also for telling prose accounts of her rich personal and family history. After convocation ended, I attended an additional poetry performance by Amena so that I could hear more of her work. I wasn’t disappointed. She has a skill with words and a gift for sharing them, for speaking directly into the hearts of her audience.</p>
