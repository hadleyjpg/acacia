            <h5 class="red">by Betsy Shifflett</h5>
            <p class="cream">I am a busy woman. Not necessarily busier than most other women—in fact, I probably over-inflate my own busyness to make myself feel more successful instead of recognizing my actual problem of overcommitting to too many projects. Nevertheless, my days do not often hold many unscheduled minutes. I also am not Mark Zuckerberg, so despite my busy schedule, I cannot wear the same t-shirt, hoodie and jeans every day in varying colors to avoid having to think about my personal style.</p>

            <h5 class="green">Brianna Goodrich</h5>
            <p class="cream">Honestly the past years I cared a lot what people thought. People are so quick to judge what they see. The past year I wrote a little note on my website about working on my self love. Seeing my own beauty. So I decided to tone down my make up or wear none and wear literally whatever even if it didn’t make sense. But it boosted my confidence to an all time high so I just tried to slay without looking my best. So I’ve just been keeping my style to a unique minimum. I would say my style has changed a lot and probably will again.</p>

            <h5 class="mustard">by Betsy Shifflett</h5>
            <p class="cream">Among the skills we must acquire when entering the adult world is an understanding of personal style: which cuts look best on our body types, which colors best match our natural tones, and perhaps most importantly, how we portray our personalities and goals through the way we dress. Learning how to dress is among the true necessities of learning how to “adult.”  In its own way, it is just as vital learning to do your taxes or change a tire. The concept of dressing well, however, is sometimes more easily said than done.</p>

            <h2>10x10 challenge</h2>
            <h5>by Jen Stratton</h5>
            <p class="cream">Picture this: a frantic blonde twenty-something scrambles to toss together an acceptable outfit while the clock ticks mercilessly towards the start of the work day. That twenty-something is me, and I have a problem. Wake up. Do my hair and makeup if it’s a good day. (Who am I kidding? I haven’t seen my hairbrush in months.) Open the closet and stare into its murky depths. Choose an outfit. Put on the outfit. Change the outfit. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.</p>
