# Acacia Magazine

This is a project created for the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development course. Acacia Magazine is a project I worked on in college with fellow female students. I created a print magazine with these articles and used that content to create this site.

## Forms

The contact forms are not fully functioning. I added them to site so I could work on formatting them with CSS.


## Article Links

I did not create individual pages for each article so the 'Read More' buttons will not connect to a page.
