# Acacia Magazine

This is a project created for the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development course. Acacia Magazine is a project I worked on in college with fellow female students. I created a print magazine with these articles and used that content to create this site.

## Forms

The contact forms are not fully functioning. I added them to site so I could work on formatting them with CSS.


## Article Links

I did not create individual pages for each article so the 'Read More' buttons will not connect to a page.


## Requirements Met

I implemented a hamburger menu on mobile devices. I used flexbox to create the layout of the article excerpts on the homepage, fashion, culture, wellness & profiles pages. Lastly I created an image carousel for desktop only that displays 3 article excerpts and slides through them 1 at a time.
