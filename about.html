                <p>What’s in a name? Quite a lot, in our opinion.</p>
                <p>The African Acacia is a symbol of strength and beauty in the wilderness. Growing quickly, digging deeply, its roots grip the soil, allowing it to withstand erosion and drought. Its density provides strength as well as splendor.</p>
                <p>With its strong and enduring presence, the Acacia tree embodies the spirit of women who thrive despite their circumstances, who go against the grain—the kind of women that I admire and strive to emulate. I want to recognize these women not only so that we can pay tribute to them, but also so that we can find inspiration in their journeys. In doing so, I hope we will begin to live lives that support and celebrate other women’s dreams and successes.</p>
                <p>Acacia Magazine began with two women and a dream to create a publication, but it has grown into a team of twenty strong over the course of its development. This team has been a godsend—writers, photographers, an illustrator, a videographer and a copy editor who have all generously offered their talents and support to make Acacia the best that it can be. This collaborative journey has sparked a passion within me not just to take the road less travelled, but to pave my own pathways, as Emily describes on pg. 62.</p>
                <p>To live fully is to live appreciatively, to take into consideration our health and happiness as a whole. At Acacia, we seek to provide content that inspires all women to live full, balanced lives—lives that won’t settle for less than what we deserve 
                    and desire.</p>
                <p>I hope that in reading Acacia, you find enjoyment, inspiration and a bit of ignition to drive you forward in your own ambitions.</p>

                <p>The publication of Acacia Magazine has been a huge passion project for me and Jen. We were dreaming about the concept behind Acacia even before it was a fully-formed idea. I can think of no better use for my love of design than as a means of communicating my appreciation for “girl power” and the valuable role that it plays in 
                    our world.</p>
                <p>After spending time in South Korea and witnessing a society where women are devalued even more than in our current American society, my eyes were opened to the importance of female empowerment and the accomplishments that many of the women around us have achieved. My hope is that we have created a magazine that showcases women kicking ass, and that the examples of these women will inspire our readers to go kick some ass themselves.
                </p>
                <p>When I started working on Acacia, I wanted to create a magazine that I would love to read. After spending countless hours working with the layout of this content, I can honestly say that I fully enjoyed reading and rereading every article. We have some incredibly talented individuals behind the scenes of this project, and am so thankful for their help and encouragement.
                </p>
                <p>We are very excited to see how the first issue of this magazine is greeted, and we hope that we can continue to bring you quality content in the future.
